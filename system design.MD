# Chess Game Development Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the phased development plan for a chess game application featuring a Next.js frontend and an AI opponent powered by a local LM Studio instance.

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend Framework:** Next.js / React
- **Language:** TypeScript
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
- **State Management:** (e.g., Zustand, Redux Toolkit, Context API) - *To be decided*
- **Chess Logic Library:** (e.g., `chess.js` or custom implementation) - *To be decided*
- **AI Backend:** Local LM Studio instance via API

## Phase 1: Core Chess Logic & Engine

**Goal:** Implement the fundamental rules and mechanics of chess, independent of the UI or AI.

**Tasks:**

1.  **Board Representation:**
    *   Define data structure for the 8x8 board (e.g., 2D array, bitboard).
    *   Implement piece tracking (position, type, color).
2.  **Piece Logic:**
    *   Create base class/interface for pieces.
    *   Implement movement logic for each piece type (Pawn, Rook, Knight, Bishop, Queen, King).
    *   Implement special moves: castling, en passant, pawn promotion.
3.  **Game Engine Core:**
    *   Implement move validation (checking legality based on piece rules and board state).
    *   Implement basic turn management.
    *   Implement check detection.
    *   Implement checkmate and stalemate detection.
    *   Implement draw condition detection (50-move rule, repetition - *optional initial*).
4.  **Move Generation:**
    *   Implement a function to calculate all legal moves for the current player.
5.  **Unit Testing:**
    *   Write unit tests for piece movements, move validation, check/checkmate detection.

## Phase 2: Basic User Interface & Interaction

**Goal:** Create a visual representation of the board and allow basic user interaction.

**Tasks:**

1.  **Board Rendering:**
    *   Create React component(s) to display the board and pieces based on the game state from Phase 1.
2.  **Basic Interaction:**
    *   Implement user input for selecting pieces and target squares (e.g., click-to-move or drag-and-drop).
    *   Connect UI interactions to the game engine's move validation.
    *   Update the UI visually after a valid move is made.
3.  **Game Information Display:**
    *   Display the current turn.
    *   Display basic game status (e.g., "Check").
4.  **State Management (Frontend):**
    *   Choose and integrate a state management solution (if needed beyond basic React state) to manage the game state in the UI.
5.  **Integration Testing:**
    *   Test the interaction between UI components and the core game engine.

## Phase 3: AI Integration (LM Studio)

**Goal:** Connect the frontend game to the local LM Studio AI for opponent moves.

**Tasks:**

1.  **API Service:**
    *   Create a service/module in the Next.js app to handle communication with the LM Studio API.
2.  **State Representation for AI:**
    *   Define the format for sending the board state to the AI (e.g., FEN string).
3.  **AI Move Request:**
    *   Implement logic to send the current board state to the AI when it's the AI's turn.
4.  **AI Move Processing:**
    *   Implement logic to receive the AI's move response.
    *   Validate the AI's move using the game engine.
    *   Apply the validated AI move to the game state and update the UI.
5.  **AI Decision Making Configuration (LM Studio Side):**
    *   Ensure LM Studio is configured with an appropriate model/prompt for chess move generation.
    *   *Note: AI's internal scoring/evaluation logic resides within the LM Studio model itself.*
6.  **Error Handling:**
    *   Implement handling for API errors or invalid moves returned by the AI.

## Phase 4: Enhancements & Polish

**Goal:** Add features that improve the user experience and game completeness.

**Tasks:**

1.  **Game State Management:**
    *   Implement game state representation for saving/loading (board, turn, castling, en passant, history).
    *   Implement persistence (e.g., local storage).
    *   Implement save/load functionality via UI menus.
    *   Implement move history tracking.
    *   Implement undo/redo functionality.
2.  **UI Polish:**
    *   Implement display for captured pieces (using client-side state array).
    *   Improve game status display (Checkmate, Stalemate, Draw).
    *   Add menus/options (New Game, Settings).
    *   Refine styling and animations.
3.  **Testing:**
    *   Write E2E tests simulating full gameplay loops.
    *   Expand unit and integration tests for new features.

## Future Considerations (Post-MVP)
-   AI opponent with multiple difficulty levels (may require different models/prompts in LM Studio or parameter adjustments).
-   Online multiplayer capabilities.
-   Opening book integration.
-   Endgame database integration.
-   Game analysis tools.
-   Timer/Clock implementation.

## Appendix: Technical Design Notes

*   **Modularity:** Maintain separation between UI, game engine, and AI communication layers.
*   **Immutability:** Use immutable updates for game state where practical.
*   **Performance:** Keep move generation/validation efficient.
*   **Testability:** Design components for easy testing.
*   **AI Input/Output:** Standardize the format for board state (to AI) and move notation (from AI).
